## Gantt Chart Generator ##

This open source Jupyter notebook workflow allows a quick and neat Gantt Chart generation process. Workflow relies on some data cleaning and sorting based on the dates provided. 

An example dataset is located under assets folder while global functions are stored ın the utils folder.

The Gantt Charts can be generated for all tasks or by filtering tasks based on their type (technical or commercial for this case). 

In addition, tasks/projects are dısplayed as **Planned**, **Ongoing** and **Finished**.

An example outcome of the workflow;
